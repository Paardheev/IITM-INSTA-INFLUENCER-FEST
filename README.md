# IITM-INSTA-INFLUENCER-FEST
C++ mini project simulates the IITM InstaInfluencer Fest using a directed graph of event dependencies. It employs DFS for cycle detection, SCC analysis, and topological sorting to manage event flow, and uses dynamic programming on the DAG to compute the maximum hype scoreâ€”showcasing advanced algorithms and OOP.
